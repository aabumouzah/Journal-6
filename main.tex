\begin{itemize}
    \item I'm still little struggling with organizing my ideas and add them all togather.
    \item I'm still struggling on what points should I focus more with my survey. I need to be different from the previous published ones. 
    \item I still find more related papers that need to be reviews just to be more accurate with the information that I'm going to include. 
    \item I'm thinking about either writing a discussion section, if not then I will include those questions in the conclusion.
    \item Still need to think deep when analyzing my literature for comparison purpose.
    \item Still need to link the ideas I go with my literature.
    \item Still not sure if should I create a table for analysis part. Results.
    \item As I've been writing I found it easier now placing preparing the second sections of the survey.
